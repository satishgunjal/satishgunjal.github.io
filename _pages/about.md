### **Objective Of Linear Model**
Every machine learning model actually generalize the relationship between input variables and output variables. In case of linear regression since relationship is linear, this generalization can be represented by simple line function. Lets consider the below example, input values are ploted on X axis and output values are plotted on Y axis.

Since there are only few data point we can easily eyeball it and draw a best fit line, which will generalize the relationship between input and output varaibles for us.

Since this line generalises the reltionship between input and output values for any prediction on given input value, we can simply plot it on a line and Y cordinate for that point will give us the prediction value.

So our objective is to find the best fit line which will generalize the given training data for future predictions.
