# Machine Learning Algorithms <a id ="1"></a>

This series is for absolute beginners. I have created a learning plan and tried to explain every concept from basics. Few tutorials also contain the end-to-end algorithms without using any library for better understanding and intuition. You will also learn to use **scikit-learn** a free software machine learning library at the end of this series.
